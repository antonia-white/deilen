## UX

### Colour Scheme
- An earthy and natural blend of pastel pink yellow and green with darker shades of clay-brown and blue-grey. This gives the website a fresh, organic and natural look.
    >![colour palette](documentation/testing/deilen-colours.png)
- No accessibility issues were returned when passing the colour scheme through the official [WebAIM contrast checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/).
    >![webaim screenshot](documentation/testing/webaim-screenshot.png)

### Typography

- Google Fonts
  Font styles were taken from the open source [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
  - The typography for the text throughout the website is [Work Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Work+Sans). This font was designed by Wei Huang and is optimised for on-screen text usage at medium-sizes (14px-48px). Overall, features are simplified and optimised for screen resolutions; for example, diacritic marks are larger than how they would be in print. This font is loosely based on early Grotesques and, in my opinion, gives the website a crisp feel.
  - The typography for the brand logo and page titles is font-family [Corben](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Corben). This was designed by Vernon Adams Corben as a simple web friendly display font with ample curves and ligatures. Corben is designed to be easy on the eye with a touch of classic display lettering. For me, Corben gives the logo and headers a classic, sophisticated feel. 
- Accessibility
  - The website was designed with accessibility in mind, by providing alt attributes for all img elements and being mindful of visual impairment when designing the website. For example, originally I had a hover effect to increase font-size on footer links. After consideration this was removed as the hover effect caused vertical displacement.

## Features 

### Existing Features 

__Navigation Bar__
  - Allows the user to navigate around the Deilen site. The Deilen logo will direct the user to the homepage, there's an Account Management button with dropdown options relating to profile creation and login, there's a Plants button for easy access to the shop floor, and there's a button to take a user to their Shopping Cart or "wheelbarrow". The wheelbarrows icon changes to blue if there are items currently sitting in the bag.
  - The search bar allows users to search for a keyterm throughout the site, this is useful if the user has a particular product in mind to purchase.
  - Buttons will be available to the user depending on whether they are logged into their account or not.
  - The mobile navbar condenses all the same elements into a burger menu, this retains screenspace for other elements e.g., products.
  ![Nav Bar](documentation/testing/navbar.png)
  ![Mobile Nav Bar](documentation/testing/mobile-navbar.png)
  
  __Footer__
  - The footer contains the address of the company, useful links, business information and links to social media accounts. All of which either open modals or open new tabs directed away from the website.
  - The footer design matches that of the header to give a cohesive feel to the website.
  ![Footer](documentation/testing/footer.png)
  
  __Homepage__
  - The homepage consists of a eye-catching photo to instantly suggest the purpose of the website to the user.
  - There is a section dedicated to advertising company special offers, currently on display is the Halloween offer where free delivery is granted to orders over Â£666.
  - On the homepage there is a button overlaying the main image to direct the user to the main shop.
  - Below this are three beautifully styled info cards which inform the reader of why they should buy houseplants.
  - Finally, the last feature on the homepage is a section dedicated to Deilen and why someone should shop at this store rather than competitors.
  ![Homepage](documentation/testing/homepage.png)
  
  __Shop Floor__
  - The shop floor displays the plants that the user is able to buy through the website.
  - Each plant has its own info card where the user can see to which category the plant belongs e.g., if the plant is an air purifier or a succulent. The user can also see at a glance the care difficulty of the plant - this informs clients of the attention and care a plant needs and can therefore decide if a plant is suitable for its intended purpose.
  ![Shop Floor](documentation/testing/shop-floor.png)

  __Plant Details__
  - Each plant detail page shows the product name, price, plant type, care difficulty, and product description.
  - From this page, users can select a quantity of the product (within the range 1-99) and add the product to their wheelbarrow.
  - It's important to note that users will be unable to select a quantity less than one or greater than 99. This prevents errors when ordering.
  ![Shop Floor](documentation/testing/plant-detail.png)

  __Product Filtering__
  - From the shop floor, users will be able to filter plant products based on the product price, alphabetically as well as filtering by plant type and plant care difficulty.
  - This allows users to shop a more selective list of products if they are looking for something specific.
  ![Product filtering](documentation/testing/filter-all.png)
  ![Product filtering by type](documentation/testing/filter-type.png)
  ![Product filtering by difficulty](documentation/testing/filter-difficulty.png)
  
  __Shopping Bag ("Wheelbarrow")__
  - The wheelbarrow is always accessible to users, even when empty. The wheelbarrow allows users to view what is currently in their bag for purchase. From here, a user can amend their order, continue shopping or proceed to checkout.
  ![Wheelbarrow](documentation/testing/wheelbarrow.png)
  
  __Checkout__
  - Once item(s) have been added to the wheelbarrow the user will then be able to checkout. Upon checkout there is a brief review of the users basket i.e., what they intend to purchase. The user will then be required to fill out their delivery information and then proceed to fill out their payment information. Once payment is completed the order is made.
  - A user will also be prompted to make an account at Deilen in order to store their delivery information to speed up future checkouts.
  ![Checkout](documentation/testing/checkout.png)

  __Order Confirmation__
  - One payment has been processed and an order created, a user will be directed to an order confirmation page listing their order details and a button to redirect back to the store. Additionally, there will be a toast alerting the user of their order success and a confirmation email will be sent to the email adress the customer provided.
  ![Order confirmation page](documentation/testing/order-confirmation-page.png)
  ![Order confirmation email](documentation/testing/order-confirmation-email.png)

__Contact Us__
  - If a user wants to contact Deilen, they can do so by filling out the form on the Contact Us page. Once the user has submitted this form they will be redirected to a success page to inform them that their message has been received and the company will be in touch shortly. An admin can see submitted contact forms in the django admin for the site.
  ![Contact Us page](documentation/testing/contact-form.png) 
  ![Message received page](documentation/testing/message-recieved.png) 

__Account Management__
  - A user is able to create a profile by registering an account. Having an account allows users to save delivery details for faster checkout and to view past order history.
  - A user can navigate and manage their account by using the button dropdown in the navbar.
  - A user can sign in and out of their account, they are also able to reset their password via email verification. The back-end functionality of accounts is handled by django-allauth.
  ![Register](documentation/testing/register.png) 

__Profile__
  - A user's profile displays the user's past order confirmations alongside their default delivery information. Delivery information can be edited and saved in their profile to ensure their account details are always accurate.
  ![Order history](documentation/testing/order-history.png) 
  ![Order summary](documentation/testing/order-summary.png) 
  ![Update profile](documentation/testing/update-profile.png) 


### Admin Features

Only admins have access to product management and only admins can view all orders, products, product categories, and customer messages. Please see [TESTING.md](TESTING.md)'s defensive programming section to see how I prevented general site users from accessing admin features.

__Adding Plants__
  - An admin has the ability to add new products by navigating to the product management section under their account, which of course requires an admin signin. Completing and submitting the add plant form will result in a new product being displayed on the site. This will create a permanent object in the database which will remain until updated or deleted. Users will now be able to purchase this product.

  ![Product management navigation](documentation/testing/product-management-nav.png)
  ![Add product](documentation/testing/add.png)

__Editing Plants__
  - From a plant's details page, an admin can easily update the details of said product. Clicking update opens a form, once completed and saved the data on this plant will be updated in the database.
  - These admin control buttons (update and delete) are only present if the user that is logged in is a superuser i.e., an admin account.

  ![Admin controls](documentation/testing/admin-update-delete.png)
  ![Update form](documentation/testing/update-form.png)

__Deleting Plants__

  - From a plant's details page, an admin can easily delete said product. Before deletion a modal is triggered to ensure no accidental deletion.
  - Once deleted this plant product will be permenantly deleted from the database.
  - Admin control buttons (update and delete) are only present if the user that is logged in is a superuser i.e., an admin account.

  ![Delete modal](documentation/testing/delete.png)

__Django Admin__

  - All site information can be viewed when an admin logs into the customised django admin. This includes full orders, customer messages and ability to manage plant categories and products. Django provides a built in admin interface which acts as a internal management tool. More information can be read about Django admin [here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/contrib/admin/). Deilen's django admin can be accessed [here](https://deilen-shop.herokuapp.com/admin/) (please note, admin login is required). 
  
  ![Django admin screenshot](documentation/testing/django-admin.png)


### Making an admin account

Admin accounts are defined as superusers and have to be made a specific way, different to a normal Deilen customer account.

To make an admin account for your local workspace:
  - In the CLI run `python3 manage.py createsuperuser` then provide an admin username and password. 
  - You can then login to your admin account with this username and password to get admin privileges.

To make an admin account for a deployed Heroku site:
  - Ensure your git repository is connected to the Heroku app.
  - Make sure a remote has been established for the Heroku app (you can check this by running `git remote -v` in your terminal).
  - You will now need to login to your Heroku account in the CLI, to do this run `heroku login -i` and provide your Heroku email address associated with your account and account password.
  - Ensure all migrations have been made to the Heroku app.
  - Create a superuser by running `heroku run python3 manage.py createsuperuser`.
  - You can then login to your admin account with this username and password to get admin privileges.


### Features Left to Implement 

- Update preloader to be more themed to the site.
  - This has not yet been done due to time constraints, so [Bootstrap's spinners](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/components/spinners/#about) have been used as an interim. 
  - In the future, I will work to replace the Bootstrap spinner with either this [potted-plant](https://icons8.com/icon/OKMC0MrrQY5I/potted-plant) or [plant in sunshine](https://icons8.com/icon/YW744aCDWOMe/plant) preloader.

- Add digital wallets for easier checkout.
  - This would make checkout simpler and faster for the user by paying with the click of a button rather than filling out their card details into the Stripe input.
  - However, Stripe's documentation warns that the integration of digital wallets are "currently only available in the U.S., and not yet available in the UK and euro area." Therefore, this would need to change or I would need to change online payment provider before this could be implemented.
  - Please see the [Stripe Docs](https://stripe.com/docs/issuing/cards/digital-wallets) explaining how digital wallets can be intergrated into Stripe in the US.

- Auto populate countries field with the value 'United Kingdom' as Deilen are currently unable to ship abroad.
  - This would be useful to prevent users having to needlessly scroll through the country input to select the UK - as this is currently the only shipping destination.
  - I intend to implement this feature by following this [documentation](https://pypi.org/project/django-countries/#show-certain-countries-first) and discourse on [this stackoverflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44025372/setting-a-default-value-in-choicfield-in-django).

- Checkout Webhooks
  - Adds redundancy to the order payment in case the browser is closed after the payment is confirmed but before the order form has been submitted. This would stop the chance of payment going through without the order having been created.
  - I would follow the [Stripe documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks) on webhooks and follow Code Institute's walkthrough project in order to implement webhooks in my site.

## Testing

To view all testing documentation, refer to [TESTING.md](TESTING.md).

***

## Deployment

The site was deployed to Heroku. The live link can be found [here](https://deilen-shop.herokuapp.com/)

The steps to deploy a Heroku app are as follows: 
1.  Log in to Heroku or create an account if required.
2.  Create a Heroku app - select 'New', from the drop-down menu select Create New App. The app name provided must be unique.
3.  Select a region.
4.  Create.
5.  Navigate to the Resources tab and add a Heroku PostgreSQL database.
6.  Access the Settings Tab and find the Config Vars. For this project you will need the following config vars:
    *   DATABASE_URL = the url of your heroku postgres database.
    *   SECRET_KEY = a secret key for your app.
    *   PORT = 5000
    *   DEBUG = set to 'True' during development and 'False' upon deployment.
    *   IP = Your IP address.
    *   USE_AWS = set to 'True'.
    *   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = amazon web services publishable API key.
    *   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = amazon web services secret API key, must be stored securly.
    *   STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY = stripes publishable API key.
    *   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = stripes secret API key, must be stored securly.
    *   EMAIL_HOST_PASS = 16 character password given once SMTP server setup in mail account settings.
    *   EMAIL_HOST_USER = the active email address that site emails will be sent from.

  Please see this [official documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars) on Heroku configuration for more details.

7.  Navigate to the Deploy tab.
8.  Select Github as the deployment method.
9.  Follow steps to link to the appropriate GitHub account.
12. If you wish, enable Automatic Deploys for automatic deployment when you push updates to Github. Or alternatively, select the correct branch for deployment from the drop-down menu and click Deploy Branch for manual deployment.

Final steps: 
1. Create a Procfile in your repository containing `web: gunicorn deilen.wsgi:application` so that Heroku will identify that Gunicorn is acting as the webserver and run using the projects wsgi module.
2. Create an untracked file called env.py in your repo and input the config vars you previously established in Heroku.
3. Create a requirements.txt file
    - If you want to freeze your own packages into this file, run `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt` in the console.
    - To install only the packages that are already listed in the Deilen repo requirements (if making a local copy/clone) run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` in the console.


### Setting up Stripe
For instruction to set upstripe payments, please visit [the Stripe documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment#web-collect-card-details).
Provided below is a brief explanation of Stripe setup:

1. Create a **stripe account** at [stripe.com](https://stripe.com/en-gb)
2. In the terminal, install Stripe:
```
pip3 install stripe
```
3. In the project settings file, ensure `STRIPE_CURRENCY` is set to 'gbp' and `STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY` and `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` are retirived from the environment, with a default empty value, e.g.:
```
STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY = os.environ.get('STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY', '')
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('STRIPE_SECRET_KEY', '')
```
4. These API keys are avliable to you from the **home** page of your Stripe account, under a section titled **"for developers"**. Copy the **Publishable key** and assign it to a new Heroku config var called `STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY`. Then do the same for the **Secret key**, assigning it to a config var called `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`.


### Setting up AWS
The deployed site uses AWS S3 Buckets to store the webpages static and media files. More information on how you can set up an AWS S3 Bucket can be found below:

1. Create an AWS account [here](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup#/start/email).
2. Login and locate **S3 buckets** and create a new bucket.
3. Underneath **Object Ownership** select **ACLs enabled**.
4. Uncheck **Block Public Access** to make the bucket public, then finally **Create Bucket**.
5. Inside your new bucket navigate to the **Properties** tab. Within **Static Website Hosting** click **Edit** and edit the Static website hosting to **Enabled**. Copy the default values for the index and error documents and click **Save Changes**.
6. Navigate to the **Permissions** tab, within **Cross-origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**, click **Edit** and then paste in the following:

  ```
    [
        {
            "AllowedHeaders": [
            "Authorization"
            ],
            "AllowedMethods": [
            "GET"
            ],
            "AllowedOrigins": [
            "*"
            ],
            "ExposeHeaders": []
        }
    ]
  ```

7. In the **Bucket Policy** section click **Edit** and then **Policy Generator**. Open the **Select Type of Policy** dropdown, select **S3 Bucket Policy** and within **Principle** allow all principals by typing *.
8. Open up **Actions** dropdown menu, now select **Get Object** and in the previous tab copy the **Bucket ARN number**. Paste this in the policy generator in the **Amazon Resource Name (ARN)** field.
9. **Add statement > Generate Policy** and copy the generated policy, paste this into the **Bucket Policy Editor**.
10. Before saving, add /* at the end of your **Resource Key**, this will allow access to all resources within the bucket. Save.
11. Find **Access Control List (ACL)** and **Edit**.
12. Next to **Everyone (public access)**, check the **list** checkbox and save your changes.

#### IAM

1. Within IAM, in the sidebar select **User Groups** and then **Create group**, name the group.
2. In **Policies**, **Create policy**.
3. Navigate to the JSON tab and select **Import Managed Policy**, search for **S3** and select **AmazonS3FullAccess** followed by **Import**.
4. Navigate back to your S3 bucket and copy the **ARN Number**. Return to **This Policy** and update the **Resource Key** including your ARN Number . Copy this line to include all files by adding /* at the end. This code section should look like the following:
```
"Resource": [
    "YOUR-ARN-NUMBER-HERE",
    "YOUR-ARN-NUMBER-HERE/*"
]
```

5. Ensure the policy is named and has a description, then **Create Policy**.
6. Within the group created earlier, under permissions click **Add Permission** and select **Attach Policies**.
7. In the sidebar find **Users** and **Add User**.
8. Provide a username and check **Programmatic Access**, then click 'Next'.
9. Ensure the new policy is selected and navigate through until you click **Add User**.
10. VERY IMPORTANT: Download the **CSV file**, this contains the user's AWS access key and AWS secret access key.


#### Connecting AWS to Django

1. In the terminal:

```
  pip3 install boto3
  pip3 install django-storages 
```  

2. Add **storages** to your installed apps within your settings.py file.
3. In settings.py file add:

```
if 'USE_AWS' in os.environ:
    AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = 'your-bucket-name-here'
    AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = 'your-region-here'
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.environ.get('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID')
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = os.environ.get('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')
```
4. Add  `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` to Heroku config vars. These can be found in the CSV file downloaded when setting up AWS.
5. Add `USE_AWS` to Heroku config vars with value set to 'True'.
6. Remove the `DISABLE_COLLECTSTAIC` variable.
7. Within your settings.py add: 

```
  AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN = f'{AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME}.s3.amazonaws.com'
```
8. Within the bucket config in settings.py, add:

```
STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.StaticStorage'
STATICFILES_LOCATION = 'static'
DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.MediaStorage'
MEDIAFILES_LOCATION = 'media'

STATIC_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{STATICFILES_LOCATION}/'
MEDIA_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{MEDIAFILES_LOCATION}/'

AWS_S3_OBJECT_PARAMETERS = {
    'Expires': 'Thu, 31 Dec 2099 20:00:00 GMT',
    'CacheControl': 'max-age=94608000',
}
```

9. In the root directory of your project create **custom_storages.py**. Include the following:

```
  from django.conf import settings
  from storages.backends.s3boto3 import S3Boto3Storage

  class StaticStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
    location = settings.STATICFILES_LOCATION

  class MediaStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
    location = settings.MEDIAFILES_LOCATION
```

10. Navigate back to you AWS S3 Bucket and **Create Folder** called **media**, you can then **Upload > Add Files** all media files needed for the site.
11. Under **Permissions** select the option **Grant public-read access** and click **Upload**.
