  __Shop Floor__
  - The shop floor displays the plants that the user is able to buy through the website.
  - Each plant has its own card, the user can see to which category the plant belongs e.g., if the plant is an air purifier or a succulent. The user can also see at a glance the care difficulty of the plant - this informs clients of the attention and care a plant needs and can therefore decide if a plant is suitable for its intended purpose.
  - Each plant product displays a price per item as well as a field to select a quantity of the product (max quantity selection is 99 items of a single product).

  __Checkout__
  - Once item(s) have been added to the wheelbarrow the user will then be able to checkout. Upon checkout there is a brief review of the users basket i.e., what they intend to purchase.

## Testing

To view all testing documentation, refer to [TESTING.md](TESTING.md).

***

## Deployment

The site was deployed to Heroku. The live link can be found [here](link to deployed site)

The steps to deploy a Heroku app are as follows: 
1.  Log in to Heroku or create an account if required.
2.  Create a Heroku app - select 'New', from the drop-down menu select Create New App. The app name provided must be unique.
3.  Select a region.
4.  Create.
5.  Navigate to the Resources tab and add a Heroku PostgreSQL database.
6.  Access the Settings Tab and find the Config Vars. For this project you will need the following config vars:
    *   MONGO_DBNAME = the name of your mongo database.
    *   MONGO_URI = the uri for your mongo database.
    *   DATABASE_URL = the url of your heroku postgres database.
    *   SECRET_KEY = a secret key for your app.
    *   PORT = 5000
    *   DEBUG = set to 'True' during development and 'False' upon deployment.
    *   IP = Your IP address

  Please see this [official documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars) on Heroku configuration for more details.

7.  Navigate to the Deploy tab.
8.  Select Github as the deployment method.
9.  Follow steps to link to the appropriate GitHub account.
12. If you wish, enable Automatic Deploys for automatic deployment when you push updates to Github. Or alternatively, select the correct branch for deployment from the drop-down menu and click Deploy Branch for manual deployment.

Final steps: 
1. Create a Procfile in your repository containing `web: python run.py` so that Heroku will identify the app as a Python app.
2. Create an untracked file called env.py in your repo and input the config vars you previously established in Heroku.
3. Create a requirements.txt file
    - If you want to freeze your own packages into this file, run `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt` in the console.
    - To install only the packages that are already listed in the Deilen repo requirements (if making a local copy/clone) run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` in the console.

### Cloning

Cloning a repository makes it easier to contribute, fix merge conflicts, add or remove files, and push larger commits. To clone this repository from GitHub to a local computer use the following steps:

1.  On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.

2.  Above the list of files, click Code.

3.  Click Use GitHub CLI, then the copy icon.

4.  Open Git Bash and change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.

5.  Type git clone, and then paste the URL that was copied from step 3 above - i.e., `git clone https://github.com/antonia-white/deilen.git`

6. Press Enter to create the local clone.

### Forking
A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.

To fork this project go to the top left of the repository, where you see the Fork Icon and click Fork.  This will create a copy of the repository for you.
